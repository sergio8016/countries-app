Certainly! Here is an improved version of your `Readme.md`:

# Countries Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3. It uses the free [Countries REST API](https://restcountries.com/) to explore new features of Angular versions 17 and 18.

## Running the Development Server

After cloning and downloading the project, run `ng serve -o` to start a development server. This command will automatically open the application in your default web browser.

## Exploring New Angular 17/18 Features

### New Lazy Loading Syntax

Angular 17/18 introduces a simplified syntax for lazy loading components. Here’s an example:

```typescript
{
  path: 'byCapital',
  loadComponent: () => import('./pages/by-capital-page/by-capital-page.component').then(m => m.ByCapitalPageComponent)
}
```

### `@for` Loop

Another new feature is the `@for` loop, which enhances template syntax for iterating over collections. Here’s how it can be used:

```html
@for (link of links; track link) {
  <li
    class="list-group-item"
    [routerLink]="link.url"
    routerLinkActive="active"
    [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact: true}"
   >
    {{ link.label }}
  </li>
}
```
